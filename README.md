# Number Guessing Game in Java

This is a simple number guessing game I built while learning Java.

The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100. The player has to guess the number. After each guess it tells you if you are too high or too low.

It keeps going until you get the right answer. It also counts how many tries you took.

This is one of my first Java console projects. Just practicing the basics like loops conditionals and user input.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Enter Terminal commands below:
   ```
   javac NumberGuessingGame.java
   ```
5. Run the program:
   ```
   java NumberGuessingGame
   ```

The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, it will tell you if you are too high or too low. When you guess correctly, it will show how many attempts you took. Youâ€™ll also be asked if you want to play again.
