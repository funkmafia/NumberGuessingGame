# Number Guessing Game in Java

This is a simple number guessing game I built while learning Java.

The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100. The player has to guess the number. After each guess it tells you if you are too high or too low.

It keeps going until you get the right answer. It also counts how many tries you took.

This is one of my first Java console projects. Just practicing the basics like loops conditionals and user input.
